# Feelings etc.

Feeling good. I expect to learn to use git version control system and R better in data science framework. I found the course from Sisu. 
R for Health Data Science seems to be clear and user-friendly introduction to R.
My favourite topic is probably the tuning plots, chapter 5. 
I expect the most difficult topics to relate regression models and tests
that require some statistical understanding. Starting with R Markdown from the start is a good idea.
